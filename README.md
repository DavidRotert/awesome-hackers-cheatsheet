# Awesome Hackers Cheatsheet
Cheatsheets and notes for my pentesting journey.

Made with Obsidian. If you wanna use my notes, I recommend using Obsidian too so you can also benefit from their Markdown format with backlinks, the graph view, tags etc.

You can freely use this information provided in my notes.
